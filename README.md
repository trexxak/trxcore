# Trexxak

> A symbolic grammar of truth, intent, and transformation.

Trexxak is a minimalist symbolic language — not for machines, but for **minds**.

It replaces verbose syntax, quoting, and escape characters with a **structural grammar** rooted in human cognition. It doesn't model natural language. It models **symbolic thought**.

## ✦ What does Trexxak do?

Trexxak lets you:

- Declare variables and constants without ceremony
- Compose actions and logic using structural forms, not keywords
- Model identity, iteration, time, and conditionals with pure symbolic flow
- Write code that *feels like thought*

No brackets. No `if`. No `for`. No quotes unless you really want them.

Just this:

```trexxak
#name|Nova _|
!|log:Hello #name _|
```

## ✦ Examples

Trexxak is self-explanatory if you let it be:

```trexxak
#state|active _|

!?|#state:active
    !|log:Running _|
_|
```

## ✦ Philosophy

Trexxak believes:

- Escape is weakness.
- Scope is strength.
- Identity is shape, not type.
- Every structure is iterable.
- Commas only split if you let them.

Trexxak doesn’t try to be a language.  
It tries to be **a mirror for structure**.

## ✦ Status

Trexxak is a live experiment.  
You are welcome to fork it, extend it, or break it.  
It wants you to make it weirder.
