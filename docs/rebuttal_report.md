# Response to the Skeptical Review

The document `skeptical_report.md` raised several points questioning the value of Trexxak.
This report addresses those concerns and outlines improvements.

## Acknowledging the Issues

- **Minimal parser** – The original parser lacked error handling. Unmatched
  closing markers could silently pass. A `strict` mode has been added so the
  parser can raise `ValueError` when encountering unmatched closures or when
  blocks remain open at EOF.
- **Translator limits** – While the translator still produces a concise English
  summary, it now strips residual symbols and converts call blocks to `call`
  statements. Complex structures remain simplified, and further work is needed to
  capture nuance.
- **Benchmarks** – The skeptical report correctly notes that Python's AST parser
  is faster. Trexxak's parser takes about a second for 1000 parses on the test
  machine. This remains acceptable for interactive use but is slower than
  CPython.

## Improvements

- Added structural validation to the parser with corresponding unit tests.
- Expanded the test suite to include error conditions and example files.
- Updated documentation to reflect how Trexxak can function as an intermediary
  representation similar to simple HTML round‑trips.

## Conclusion

Trexxak's tooling is still experimental, but the language is capable of being
parsed, validated and translated in a lightweight manner. The skeptic rightly
pointed out shortcomings in error handling and performance comparison. Those have
been addressed with explicit validations and clearer benchmarking data, showing
Trexxak can serve as a workable midwife language between humans and LLMs.
