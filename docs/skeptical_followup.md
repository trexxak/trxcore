# Follow-up Skeptical Review

The same skeptical researcher revisited Trexxak after the rebuttal and testing reports. While some improvements are acknowledged, the researcher remains critical of the language's ultimate usefulness.

## Acknowledged Improvements

- **Error Handling** – Strict mode in the parser now throws exceptions for unmatched or unclosed blocks, addressing a major complaint from the first review.
- **Cleaner Translation** – The translator strips extraneous markers and converts call blocks, producing more readable output.
- **Broader Testing** – Unit tests now parse all example files and benchmark Trexxak against Python's AST parser, demonstrating a minimal but functioning toolchain.

## Ongoing Concerns

- **Expressiveness** – The skeptic argues that Trexxak's terse tokens still obscure meaning. Even with translation, it feels like shorthand for plain English, offering little advantage over existing markup languages.
- **Performance** – Benchmarks show the parser is serviceable but not competitive with mature tools. For large-scale use, Python's AST or even lightweight XML parsers remain faster and better supported.
- **Adoption** – Without a clear killer feature or real-world examples, the skeptic doubts Trexxak will gain traction beyond hobbyist curiosity.

In summary, the improvements are noted but the researcher remains unconvinced that Trexxak solves a real problem. They see it as a niche experiment rather than a practical midwife between humans and LLMs.
