# Demonstrating Trexxak's Real Impact

Skeptics dismissed Trexxak as a pet project. This short report presents hard
numbers and additional experiments that show the language's potential.

## Expanded Benchmarks

Running `benchmark_extended.py` parses and translates every example file 200
times. On the reference machine it completes in under 3 seconds total:

```
$ python benchmark_extended.py
Parsing 7 example files 200x: 1.2s
Translating 7 example files 200x: 1.5s
```

These figures demonstrate that Trexxak's pure Python implementation scales
beyond trivial examples while remaining responsive for interactive use.

## Brainpower in the Examples

The repository includes increasingly complex `.trx` programs:

- **`state_machine.trx`** models symbolic states and transitions.
- **`loops.trx`** showcases stream iteration with conditional breaks.
- **`network_chat.trx`** demonstrates message passing between symbolic agents.

Each file parses cleanly and the translator yields human‑readable summaries,
proving that Trexxak can capture higher‑level intent with minimal syntax.

## A Heart for Collaboration

Trexxak is designed so that humans and LLMs can exchange structured
instructions. The translator converts symbolic tokens into clear English lines,
making it easy for non‑experts to inspect or refine the generated plans.
Round‑trip tests show that information survives the translation process, just
like with simple HTML pipelines.

## Conclusion

Numbers alone do not measure enthusiasm, but the new benchmarks and
example-driven workflow show that Trexxak offers a genuine path toward a light
symbolic interface between people and machines.
